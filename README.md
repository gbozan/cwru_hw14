This project is about exploring the bacteria found in people's belly buttons using an interactive dashboard.
I used D3 to pull data from a JSON file and created a bar chart, bubble chart, and metadata panel that update when a new sample is picked.
The data shows that a few types of bacteria are common in most people, but most bacteria are pretty rare, which makes each sample unique.
